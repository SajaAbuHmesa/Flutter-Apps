# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Timer – Flutter Implementation

This is a clean Flutter implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game with modern UI and enhanced features, including score tracking, a countdown timer, and win detection with visual feedback.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository includes only the `lib/`, `pubspec.yaml`, and `pubspec.lock` files to showcase the core game logic and UI.  
> To run the app, simply create a new Flutter project and replace the default files with those from this repository.

## 📁 Code Structure

### Main Components
- `GameScreen` widget – main game interface
- Game logic and state management
- Countdown timer integration
- UI components: grid, timer, scores, reset button

### Key Methods
- `startTimer()` – starts the round timer
- `stopTimer()` – stops the current timer
- `resetTimer()` – resets the timer to initial state
- `_tapped()` – processes tile taps and switches turns
- `_checkWinner()` – checks for win/draw after each move
- `_clearBoard()` – resets the board for a new round
- `_buildTimer()` – renders the visual timer UI

---

## 🧠 State Management

The app uses local `StatefulWidget` state variables:
- `displayXO` → current board symbols
- `matchedIndexes` → indexes of winning tiles
- `oScore`, `xScore` → persistent player scores
- `oTurn` → boolean to track which player's turn it is
- `winnerFound` → game end state flag
- `seconds` → countdown value for timer

---

## 🏁 Win Detection Logic

Checks 8 possible winning combinations:
- 3 horizontal rows
- 3 vertical columns
- 2 diagonals

If all tiles are filled and no winner, game is a draw.

   - Overwrite `/lib` with the one from this repository
   - Replace `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock` in the root

3. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
